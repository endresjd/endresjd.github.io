The theming differs.</li><li>Theming inside the app is what really gives each page its layout, style, and content. Replacing the foundation theme with a custom one gives complete control.</li><li>Styling is done by css. The general look can be controlled using the Foundation theme by adjusting styles.css, but then only by duplicating the code and manually getting a replacement css file put into the resources folder. (My current understanding)</li><li>Files with web site content are markdown files, but the display of those is in HTML, so the rendering will be different. It depends on the theme, and that theme's underlying css styling. A good example is with these numbered lists. The alignment is good in markdown but way off in HTML. (This may be more aligned with how the default styling/css is setup to support his site than it does with HTML)</li><li>Default publish steps (for generating the site) are minimal, so you usually will need to enumerate out all the steps. Some, like sorting, can be missed easily and this is why the order of listed posts was unsorted.</li><li>Markdown can have raw HTML in it that can help in things like images.</li></ol><h1>Review of theme Nodes</h1><p>These are the types of pages the theme is called on to create.</p><ol><li>Index: page generated that represents the landing point for the web site. Default lists all the latest cotent.</li><li>Section: a page that displaya summaries for each file in a container, which is a folder in the Content.</li><li>Item: a page that shows the content of one of the markdown files in a container.</li><li>Page: a single page that is not part of a container. Either done in code or a markdown file in the content that is not a container (folder)</li><li>Tag List: HTML to use for the website's list of tags, if supported.</li><li>Tag Details: HTML to use for a tag details page, used to represent a single tag.</li></ol><p>Comment from addMarkdownFiles(): Parse a folder of Markdown files and use them to add content to the website. The root folders will be parsed as sections, and the files within them as items, while root files will be parsed as pages.</p><h1>Some assumptions</h1><ol><li>Maybe I don't have to know how it reads in and parses the files. That's at a low level, and my known exposure to that data is in the theming part with the data already parsed out into the objects I need. Control over display would be through css.</li><li>Indentation isn't something I understand well enough. It's to control if the web page uses tabs or spaces when it indents. Not sure how that might apply to web pages, so I'm leaving it alone.</li></ol><h1>Frameworks</h1><p>The whole package is broken down into subframeworks that are also from Sundell including at least one I've been using in other projects.</p><ol><li>Codextended -- Extensions giving Swift's Codable API type inference super powers</li><li>Files -- A nicer way to handle files &amp; folders in Swift</li><li>Ink -- A fast and flexible Markdown parser written in Swift</li><li>Plot -- A DSL for writing type-safe HTML, XML and RSS in Swift</li><li>Publish -- A static site generator for Swift developers</li><li>Sweep -- Fast and powerful Swift string scanning made simple</li></ol><h1>Observations</h1><ol><li>Ink framework converts Markdown into HTML. See MarkdownParser.parse()</li><li>Seems hard to customize the styling for heading tags.</li></ol></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/publish">publish</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
