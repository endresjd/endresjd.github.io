Doesn't render the way I'm expecting. This is where theming and customization probably is needed based on the layout of other pages.</p><h1 class="john">HomeBrew tools</h1><p>Working with the websites is done through a tool published with Homebrew called publish. Install that and the commands it provides become clear.</p><h2>publish new</h2><p>Set up a new website in the current folder as a Swift Package Manager project.</p><h2>publish generate</h2><p>Generate the website in the current folder.</p><h2>publish deploy</h2><p>Generate and deploy the website in the current folder, according to its deployment method.</p><h2>publish run</h2><p>Generate and run a localhost server on default port 8000 for the website in the current folder. Use the "-p" or "--port" option for customizing the default port.<br><br>Now it says very clearly, but I didn't notice, but you can regenerate the web site by running the project in Xcode instead of stopping and starting the server all the time.</p><h1 class="john">Terms</h1><h2>Website</h2><p>Protocol used to define a Publish-based website. You conform to this protocol using a custom type, which is then used to infer various information about your website when generating its various HTML pages and resources. A website is then published using a pipeline made up of PublishingStep values, which is constructed using the publish method. To generate the necessary bootstrapping for conforming to this protocol, use the publish new command line tool.</p><h2>WebsiteSectionID</h2><p>Used with an associated type to define sections for each site. The enum elements define the sections that are display across the top of the screen for the current theme. The order of the enums is the order they are displayed across the screen.</p><h2>Content</h2><p><strong>Sections</strong>	created based on the members of each websiteâ€™s SectionID enum. Each section both has its own HTML page, and can also act as a container for a list of Items. <strong>Section.md</strong> renders as a standalone page. <strong>Section/</strong> (a folder) renders the md files inside of it in a list for that section. This container can further customize the section name by defining index.md whose content is a single line with header 1 style. This defines the name that shows at the top of the container.</p><p><strong>Items</strong> which represent the nested HTML pages within that section. As I understand this, in the simplist case, an item is a markdown file inside a section folder.</p><p><strong>Pages</strong> provide a way to build custom free-form pages that can be placed into any kind of folder hierarchy. I believe, but am not certain, that this is done with the help of code.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/publish">publish</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p></footer></body></html>
